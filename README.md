# financial

Made a simple financial calculator that calculates the principal, rate and time... 
using math and decimal from python(Django framework, no frontend applied yet). 
It seems okay for beginner but there are few bugs, if yiu cqn collaborate and help me make the
calculator better, i would appricate it. 
And i am also open and willing to learn from you. 
Heres the localhost link incase you are trying to run it: http://127.0.0.1:8000/calculator/

Thanks
